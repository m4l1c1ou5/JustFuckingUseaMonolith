                <p>You probably think you need microservices. You're over here drawing service boundaries for an app
                    that doesn't exist yet. You're considering Kubernetes because some tech bro said "it scales." You're
                    splitting your codebase into 47 repositories because you read about Conway's Law once. Well guess
                    what, dipshit:</p>
            </section>

            <section class="answer">
                <h2>You just need a monolith.</h2>
                <p>That's it. That's the fucking answer. Stop Googling "microservices vs monolith" for the 73rd time.
                    Stop asking on Reddit if you should use event-driven architecture. Stop pretending you have
                    Amazon-scale problems when you have 8 users.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reasons">
                <h3>Here's why, motherfucker:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's simple and you can actually understand it</li>
                    <li>Deployment is one command, not a fucking orchestration nightmare</li>
                    <li>Debugging doesn't require distributed tracing tools</li>
                    <li>Transactions actually work without distributed sagas</li>
                    <li>Refactoring is find-and-replace, not a 6-month migration</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="objection">
                <h2>"But I need to scale!"</h2>
                <p>No you fucking don't. You know what scales? A well-written monolith. You know what doesn't? Your
                    distributed system with network calls everywhere and eventual consistency bugs you can't reproduce.
                    Shopify runs on a monolith. GitHub runs on a monolith. Stack Overflow runs on a monolith. But sure,
                    your SaaS with 12 paying customers needs to be split into 20 microservices.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="objection">
                <h2>"But microservices are more flexible!"</h2>
                <p>Flexible is just another word for "I want to make simple things complicated." You know what's
                    actually flexible? A modular monolith with clear boundaries. You can refactor it. You can test it.
                    You can deploy it without coordinating 15 different services. Microservices give you the flexibility
                    to fail in way more complicated, expensive, and fucking creative ways.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="objection">
                <h2>"But we need independent deployments!"</h2>
                <p>Why? So you can deploy your authentication service and break your entire platform because you forgot
                    about that one API contract? So you can spend 3 days debugging why the checkout flow is broken
                    because the payment service version doesn't match the order service? Deploying a monolith takes 30
                    seconds. Your microservices deployment pipeline takes 45 minutes and fails half the time.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="objection">
                <h2>"But different teams need different services!"</h2>
                <p>You have 4 developers. You don't have "teams." You have Bob, Sarah, and two juniors. They can all
                    work in the same fucking codebase. Use modules. Use packages. Use folders. You know what kills
                    productivity? Waiting for another "team" to update their API so you can finish your feature.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="objection">
                <h2>"But my startup is about to hit a million in ARR!"</h2>
                <p>Do not build for the projected scale of your startup. That scale only exists in the fucking pitch
                    deck you made at 2 AM. You're optimizing for 10 million users when you have 47. You're planning for
                    Black
                    Friday traffic when you haven't made your first sale. You know what doesn't scale? Your engineering
                    team debugging distributed transactions at 3 AM because you prematurely optimized for problems you
                    don't have.</p>

                    <li><strong>Easy debugging:</strong> Stack traces that make sense. Logs in one place. <span

                    <li><strong>Fast development:</strong> Change code, see results. No service mesh. <span
                            class="cta">Just fucking iterate.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Actual performance:</strong> In-process calls are faster than network calls. <span
                            class="cta">Just fucking use function calls.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Simple monitoring:</strong> One app, one dashboard, one alert. <span class="cta">Just

                    <!-- <li><strong>Refactoring that works:</strong> IDE refactoring actually works across your codebase.

                    <li><strong>Shared code:</strong> No copying utilities across 15 repos. <span class="cta">Just
                            fucking import it.</span></li>
                    <!-- <li><strong>One language:</strong> You don't need polyglot persistence. <span class="cta">Just

                <h2>Stop Over-Engineering Your Shit</h2>
                <p>You don't need a service mesh, an API gateway, a message queue, a service registry, distributed
                    tracing, circuit breakers, and a fucking PhD in distributed systems to build a CRUD app. You need
                    one codebase, one database, one deployment. That's it.</p>
                <p>Use a monolith. Learn to write modular code. Stop cargo-culting architecture choices from companies
                    with 10,000 engineers. Your startup with 3 developers and a Figma file doesn't need the same
                    architecture as Uber.</p>

                <h2>Yes, This is Satire (Kind Of)</h2>
                <p>Look, there ARE legitimate use cases for microservices. If you have 500 engineers and need
                    independent team autonomy, maybe microservices make sense. If you have genuinely different scaling
                    requirements for different parts of your system, maybe you need to split things up. If you're
                    Google, you probably know what you're doing.</p>
                <p>But for 95% of applications, a monolith is the right choice. It's the sensible default. Start with a
                    monolith. Keep it modular. Only split it when you have a SPECIFIC, MEASURED reason to do so. Not
                    because it's trendy. Not because you went to a conference. Because you actually have problems that
                    microservices solve.</p>
                <p class="final-word">Until then: <strong>Just. Fucking. Use. A. Monolith.</strong></p>
